# Streamlit Machine Learning App

This repository contains a simple Machine Learning application built with **Streamlit**.  
The model is trained in `a.py` using `data.csv`, and the trained model is saved as `out.pickle`.  
The `app.py` file loads this model and provides an interactive interface for predictions.
